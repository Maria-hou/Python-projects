## Projects
* [Sqlite Database Search](https://github.com/Maria-hou/Python-projects/blob/master/sqlassignment.py)
* [New Website GUI](https://github.com/Maria-hou/Python-projects/blob/master/tkinter_website.py)
* [Django Checkbook](https://github.com/Maria-hou/Python-projects/tree/master/Django_Checkbook)

## Sqlite Database Search
This program creates a database and a table, and then populates that table with files that have an extension of .txt. The data is then printed to the user.

## New Website GUI
This program utilizes tkinter as a GUI to create a website in a new tab using the text that the user entered.

## Django Checkbook
This program utilzes django to create an online checkbook where the user can create accounts, or choose from an exisiting account. The user can further input transactions, and their account balance will be calculated.
